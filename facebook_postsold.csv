"Exciting news: It‚Äôs road-building time on 3000 East, between 1580 South and 2000 South! üëç

The tedious work of laying and connecting over 14.6 miles of pipes and conduit is nearing completion. Dump trucks üöú will start delivering road base soon. The contractor will use graders and compaction equipment to place and prepare the material to begin the process of creating two new lanes on 3000 East from 1580 South to 2000 South.

Crews will be working from 2000 South and moving northward to allow the intersection of 2000 South to be fully functional as soon as possible.

When finished, 3000 East from 1580 South to 2000 South will have two lanes in each direction with a center turn lane. A new Active Transportation Trail will run along the east side separated from 3000 East with landscaping and an area for drainage.

Thank you for your patience ‚Äî we know this has been a challenge for all involved!
