"According to Lucky Miller's Deli and Market some POS broke a window out of Redding V.F.W. Post 1934 in Cypress Square and stole their donation buckets with donations in them. Normally, I would of just shared his post but he seemed quite heated about it when he wrote it.
This is a most despictable act to a community group that helps our veterans.
If you happen to know who he was I know some veterans that would love to go talk with him.
If you would like to help them with the window repair bill and/or replacing the stolen donation click the safe link to their website and directly donate to them. Thank you
